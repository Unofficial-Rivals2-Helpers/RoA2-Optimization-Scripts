# RoA2-Optimization-Scripts
Scripts to optimize Rivals of Aether 2 on low-mid-end PCs and existing handhelds

# NOTE 1: I AM NOT THE OWNER/DEVELOPER OF THESE SCRIPTS/MODS. ALL CREDIT GOES TO ZAQK AND RNG_SSB
# NOTE 2: THE LINUX SCRIPT IS FURTHER DEVELOPED THAN THE WINDOWS SCRIPT. THE WINDOWS SCRIPT INSTALLS THE FILES DIRECTLY FROM ZAQK'S GOOGLE DRIVE.

## What this script does:
Currently, there is an optimization script provided by zaqk that is available on youtube that can improve overall performance.

In addition, there is a potato mod that exists on gamebanana that also aids with improving performance as well.

In order to reduce the amount of manual steps (ie. going through directories and setting up file permissions, etc.), this script does it for you.
